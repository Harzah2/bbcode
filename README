Drupal bbcode.module README
==============================================================================

The Drupal bbcode.module adds a BBCode filter to Drupal. This allows you
to use HTML-like tags as an alternative to HTML itself for adding markup
to your posts. BBCode is easier to use than HTML and helps to prevent
malicious users from disrupting your site's formatting.

See the help screen of the module (or the code) for information on which
tags and variants are supported. This implementation is not necessarily the
same as the original BBCode implementaion.
 
Note that this filter also recognizes and converts URLs and email addresses
to links automatically.

Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  - Copy bbcode.module, bbcode-help.inc and bbcode-filter.inc to modules/bbcode/
  - Enable the module as usual from Drupal's admin pages.
 
Configuration
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - You can enable javascript encoding of emails in the configuration page
    of the module.
  - You can use bbcode filter by enabling it in an input format
  - If you would like to use BBCode as a replacement for HTML, you should
    set Drupal to use the "Filtered HTML" with escape tags setting along
    with bbcode filter.
