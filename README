README for bbcode
=================

This module lets users use bbcode in their posts. This is a safer way
of letting people include quite flexible HTML in their posts, along
with it being slightly easier for people to get the hang of.

In accordance with standard bbcode, this module automagically creates
links from typed URLs (you don't have to go [url]).

Installation
============
 - Copy bbcode.module to modules/
 - Enable the module as usual from Drupal's admin pages.

Configuration
=============
There is no configuration. It just works. :)
To turn it on and off, enable/disable the module.

TODO: - Configuration of which bbcode tags are allowed.
      - Add [list][*] support.
      - Add code to make sure tags are properly closed and nested
        (although this will make things too slow for use as an
         on-output filter, so probably needs to wait until the
         filter system gets an overhaul in 4.3)
