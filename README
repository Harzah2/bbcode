Drupal bbcode.module README
==============================================================================

The Drupal bbcode.module adds a BBCode filter to Drupal, with which you
can use HTML like tags as an alternative of HTML itself to add markup
to your posts. BBCode is easier then HTML and blocks malicious users
most of the time from screwing up the site formatting.

See the help screen of the module (or the code) for information on what
tags and variants are supported. The implementation is not necessarily the
same as the original BBCode implementaion.
 
Note that this filter also recognizes and converts URLs and email addresses
to links.

Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Required:
  - Copy bbcode.module to modules/
  - Enable the module as usual from Drupal's admin pages
 
 Optional:
  - Install the compose_tips module in order to inform your
    users about the possibility of BBCode usage

Configuration
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This module needs no configuration. After enabled it filters all text
displayed, so you can turn it off by disabling the module. If you would
like to use BBCode as an alternative to HTML, you should set Drupal to
use the "Escape HTML" filter, so no HTML tags will be allowed in posts,
just BBCode tags.
