README for bbcode
=================

This module lets users use bbcode in their posts. This is a safer way
of letting people include quite flexible HTML in their posts, along
with it being slightly easier for people to get the hang of.

In accordance with standard bbcode, this module automagically creates
links from typed URLs (you don't have to go [url]).

Installation
============
 - Copy bbcode.module to modules/
 - Enable the module as usual from Drupal's admin pages.
 - Optional. Install the compose_tips module in order to inform your users about bbcode

Configuration
=============
There is no configuration. It just works. :)
To turn it on and off, enable/disable the module.
