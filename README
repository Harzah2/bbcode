Drupal bbcode.module README
==============================================================================

The Drupal bbcode.module adds a BBCode filter to Drupal. This allows you
to use HTML-like tags as an alternative to HTML itself for adding markup
to your posts. BBCode is easier to use than HTML and helps to prevent
malicious users from disrupting your site's formatting.

See the help screen of the module (or the code) for information on which
tags and variants are supported. This implementation is not necessarily the
same as the original BBCode implementaion.
 
Note that this filter also recognizes and converts URLs and email addresses
to links automatically.

Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Required:
  - Copy bbcode.module to modules/
  - Enable the module as usual from Drupal's admin pages.
 
 Optional:
  - Install the compose_tips module to inform your users about BBCode usage.

Configuration
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This module needs no configuration. When enabled it filters all text
displayed - you can turn it off by disabling the module. If you would
like to use BBCode as a replacement for HTML, you should set Drupal to
use the "Escape HTML" filter such that no HTML tags are allowed in posts,
only BBCode tags.
